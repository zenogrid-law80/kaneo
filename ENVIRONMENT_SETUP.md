# Environment Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Kaneo development environment and troubleshoot common issues.

## Quick Start

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project with the required environment variables (see the [documentation](https://kaneo.app/docs/core/installation/environment-variables) for the complete list).

2. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

This starts both the API (port 1337) and web app (port 5173). Both will automatically reload when you make changes.

> **Tip**: The web app at http://localhost:5173 will automatically connect to the API at http://localhost:1337

## Environment Variables

Kaneo uses a **single `.env` file** in the root of the project for all environment variables. This file is shared by both the API and web services.

### Required Variables

For development, you'll need at minimum:

- `KANEO_CLIENT_URL` - The URL of the web application (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)
- `KANEO_API_URL` - The URL of the API (e.g., `http://localhost:1337`)
- `AUTH_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT token generation (**must be at least 32 characters long**; use a long, random value in production)
- `DEVICE_AUTH_CLIENT_IDS` - **Optional.** Comma-separated list of allowed device-flow OAuth client IDs. When unset, Kaneo implicitly allows `kaneo-cli` and `kaneo-mcp` by default (no extra configuration for the CLI or MCP). Override only when you need additional trusted clients, for example `kaneo-cli,kaneo-mcp,my-desktop-app`.
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `POSTGRES_DB` - PostgreSQL database name
- `POSTGRES_USER` - PostgreSQL username
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - PostgreSQL password

If your app uses a device client ID that is not included in the defaults, set `DEVICE_AUTH_CLIENT_IDS` to the full comma-separated list of allowed IDs (including any defaults you still need), so it includes the client ID your app sends to `/api/auth/device/code`.

### Database timestamps and time zones

The API opens every PostgreSQL connection with `timezone=UTC`. Most existing
columns use `timestamp without time zone`, and Drizzle writes and reads those
values as UTC. Database-generated values such as `DEFAULT now()` must use that
same convention. The database server and operating system may still use a local
time zone such as `Asia/Seoul`; no database-wide configuration change is needed.
Restart the API after updating so all pool connections use the new setting.

API timestamps serialize as ISO 8601 with `Z`. The web app displays them in the
browser's time zone; language controls formatting, not the stored instant. Do not
subtract nine hours in the UI. This convention covers comments, activity,
notifications, task creation, authentication expiry, time entries, and scheduler
deadlines. Raw SQL must send `Date` parameters as `toISOString()` when writing a
timezone-less column; node-postgres otherwise serializes dates using Node's local
time zone. Statistics date filters and monthly buckets currently use UTC days
and months.

If a deployment previously used a non-UTC database session, database-generated
timestamps may already contain local wall-clock times incorrectly interpreted as
UTC (nine hours ahead for Korea). Changing the connection prevents new incorrect
values but does not repair those rows. Explicitly supplied dates and imported
timestamps may already be correct, even in the same table. Before repairing old
data, take a backup and identify the affected write paths, deployment period,
and original time zone from independent records. Do not shift every timestamp
or infer corruption merely from a future date: due dates and expiry dates can
legitimately be in the future.

To verify locally with the API process running in Korea time:

```bash
TZ=Asia/Seoul DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/kaneo_test \
  pnpm --filter @kaneo/api test:integration database-timezone workspace-member-statistics leader-lock
```

### Development-Specific Variables

For local development, the web app also supports:
- `VITE_API_URL` - API URL for development (defaults to `http://localhost:1337` if not set)
- `VITE_APP_URL` - App URL for generating links (optional)

### Optional Variables

Kaneo supports many optional configuration options including:
- `KANEO_INTERNAL_API_URL` - API origin used only for server-side requests from the built-in HTTP MCP endpoint. Defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:1337`; override it only if the API is not reachable there from its own process.
- SSO providers (GitHub OAuth via `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, Google, Discord, Custom OAuth/OIDC)
- GitHub repository integration (GitHub App: `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, optional `GITHUB_APP_NAME`), separate from GitHub SSO
- SMTP configuration for email
- Access control settings
- CORS configuration
- Redis for horizontal scaling
- Private-network notification receivers (`KANEO_ALLOW_PRIVATE_WEBHOOK_DESTINATIONS=true` lets ntfy/Gotify/webhook destinations resolve to private addresses; off by default to prevent SSRF)

#### Redis Configuration

Kaneo supports three Redis deployment modes for WebSocket Pub/Sub. When any Redis mode is configured, WebSocket broadcasts use Redis Pub/Sub, allowing multiple API instances to relay real-time updates. When none are set, an in-memory adapter is used (single-instance only).

**Standalone (single server):**
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string (e.g., `redis://localhost:6379`)

**Sentinel (high-availability with automatic failover):**
- `REDIS_SENTINELS` - Comma-separated list of Sentinel nodes (e.g., `sentinel-1:26379,sentinel-2:26379,sentinel-3:26379`)
- `REDIS_SENTINEL_MASTER_NAME` - Name of the Sentinel master group (default: `mymaster`)
- `REDIS_SENTINEL_PASSWORD` - Password for Sentinel instances, if different from the Redis password (optional)
- `REDIS_SENTINEL_TLS` - Set to `true` to enable TLS for Sentinel connections (default: `false`)

**Cluster (horizontal sharding):**
- `REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES` - Comma-separated list of cluster seed nodes (e.g., `node-1:6379,node-2:6379,node-3:6379`)

**Shared (used by Sentinel and Cluster modes):**
- `REDIS_PASSWORD` - Password for the Redis data nodes (used by both Sentinel and Cluster modes, not for Sentinel auth itself; use `REDIS_SENTINEL_PASSWORD` for that)

> **Note:** Only one mode should be configured at a time. If multiple are set, the priority is: Cluster > Sentinel > Standalone.

#### SMTP Configuration

For sending emails (workspace invitations, magic links, etc.), configure these variables:
- `SMTP_HOST` - SMTP server hostname
- `SMTP_PORT` - SMTP server port
- `SMTP_USER` - SMTP username
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` - SMTP password
- `SMTP_FROM` - From email address
- `SMTP_SECURE` - Use TLS (default: `true`, set to `false` to disable)
- `SMTP_REQUIRE_TLS` - Require TLS (default: `false`, set to `true` to require)
- `SMTP_IGNORE_TLS` - Ignore TLS certificate errors (default: `false`, set to `true` for self-signed certificates)

> **Note:** If you're using an SMTP server with a self-signed or invalid TLS certificate, set `SMTP_IGNORE_TLS=true` to bypass certificate validation.

When SMTP is configured, sign-in uses email verification codes by default. Set `DISABLE_EMAIL_OTP_SIGN_IN=true` to use email/password sign-in instead (workspace invitation emails still use SMTP).

#### Cloud-mode abuse mitigations

Hosted multi-tenant instances should enable the cloud abuse gates. Self-hosted instances can leave these unset.

- `KANEO_CLOUD` - Set to `true` to enable cloud-only protections: disposable-email signup block, Turnstile captcha enforcement, guest-account invite block, and tightened rate limits on `/sign-up/email` and `/organization/invite-member`.
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` - Cloudflare Turnstile secret key (API container, server-side verification). When unset, captcha verification is skipped.
- `KANEO_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` - Cloudflare Turnstile site key, on the **web container**. The production web image bakes the literal placeholder `KANEO_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` into the bundle; `apps/web/env.sh` swaps it for the runtime value when the container starts.
- `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` - Local dev only. Set in `apps/web/.env` when running `pnpm dev`; Vite reads this at build/dev time. Not used in the production image.

#### Sentry (error monitoring)

All Sentry integration is opt-in; leave these unset for zero telemetry.

- `SENTRY_DSN` - Sentry DSN for the API. When unset, the Sentry SDK never initializes.
- `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` - Environment tag for API events (defaults to `NODE_ENV`).
- `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` - Fraction of API requests to trace for performance monitoring, `0`-`1` (default: `0`, tracing off).
- `KANEO_SENTRY_DSN` - Sentry DSN for the **web container** (browser errors, tracing, session replay). Same runtime-placeholder mechanism as `KANEO_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`.
- `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` - Local dev only. Set in `apps/web/.env` when running `pnpm dev`.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### CORS Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "Failed to fetch" errors in browser console
- Network errors when making API requests
- "Access to fetch at '...' from origin '...' has been blocked by CORS policy"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check URL Configuration:**
   - Ensure `KANEO_API_URL` matches your API server URL
   - Ensure `KANEO_CLIENT_URL` matches your web app URL
   - For development, you can also set `VITE_API_URL` in your `.env` file

2. **Configure CORS Origins:**
   - Add your frontend URL to `CORS_ORIGINS` in your `.env`:
     ```
     CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,https://yourdomain.com
     ```
   - For development, you can leave `CORS_ORIGINS` empty to allow all origins
   - **Note:** `CORS_ORIGINS` should match `KANEO_CLIENT_URL` for proper authentication

3. **Check Protocol Consistency:**
   - Ensure both frontend and API use the same protocol (http/https)
   - Don't mix http and https in development

4. **Verify Server Accessibility:**
   - Test if the API is accessible: `curl http://localhost:1337/config`
   - Check if the server is running on the correct port

### Database Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "Database connection failed" errors
- API server won't start

**Solutions:**

1. **Check PostgreSQL:**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
   - Verify database exists and credentials are correct
   - Test connection: `psql $DATABASE_URL`

2. **Update DATABASE_URL:**
   - Ensure the connection string format is correct
   - Check username, password, host, port, and database name

3. **Match the hostname to where the API runs:**
   - Use `postgres` only when the API container is on the same Docker Compose network as the Postgres service
   - Use `localhost` when the API runs directly on your host machine
   - If you see `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN postgres`, the API is trying to resolve the Compose hostname from the wrong network context

4. **Use the right configuration mode:**
   - For host-native development, prefer an explicit `DATABASE_URL`
   - If you derive from `POSTGRES_*`, set `POSTGRES_HOST=localhost` when running the API on your host
   - `POSTGRES_DB` and `POSTGRES_USER` by themselves do not switch Kaneo into derived connection mode

### Authentication Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "Authentication failed" errors
- Users can't sign in

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Authentication Configuration:**
   - Ensure `AUTH_SECRET` is set in your `.env` file
   - Use a strong secret in production
   - Verify `KANEO_CLIENT_URL` and `KANEO_API_URL` are correctly configured

2. **Clear Browser Data:**
   - Clear cookies and local storage
   - Try in incognito/private mode

### Network Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "Network error" messages
- API requests timeout

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Server Status:**
   - Verify API server is running
   - Check server logs for errors

2. **Check Firewall/Proxy:**
   - Ensure ports are not blocked
   - Check if proxy settings interfere

3. **Verify URLs:**
   - Check that all URLs are accessible
   - Test with curl or browser

## Development vs Production

### Development
- Use `http://localhost` for both frontend and API
- Leave `CORS_ORIGINS` empty to allow all origins (or set it to match your local URLs)
- Use simple secrets for `AUTH_SECRET` (not for production)
- The web app will use `VITE_API_URL` if set, otherwise defaults to `http://localhost:1337`

### Production
- Use HTTPS for both frontend and API
- Set specific `CORS_ORIGINS` for security (should match `KANEO_CLIENT_URL`)
- Use strong, unique secrets for `AUTH_SECRET`
- Configure proper database credentials
- Ensure `KANEO_CLIENT_URL` and `KANEO_API_URL` are set to your production URLs
